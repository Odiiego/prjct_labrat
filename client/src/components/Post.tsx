          The Wavefunction Collapse Algorithm teaches your computer how to riff.
          The algorithm takes in an archetypical input, and produces
          procedurally-generated outputs that look like it.

          It is most commonly used to create images, but is also capable of
          building <a href="#">towns</a>,<a href="#">skateparks</a>, and{' '}

        <p>
          Wavefunction Collapse is a very independent-minded algorithm, and
          needs almost no outside help or instruction. You feed it an example of
          the vibe you’re going for, and it figures everything else out for
          itself. Despite this self-sufficiency, it is surprisingly simple. It
          doesn’t use any neural networks, random forests, or anything else that
          sounds like machine learning. This makes it very clean and intuitive
          once you get the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most implementations and explanations of Wavefunction Collapse are of
          a full, performance-optimized version of the algorithm. These are of
          course important and necessary, but can be challenging to make sense
          of from a standing start. This post keeps things clear and simple by
          focussing on a constrained version of Wavefunction Collapse that I’ve
          named an Even Simpler Tiled Model. I’ve also put an{' '}
          <a href="#">example implementation of an ESTM on Github</a>. The code
          is inefficient and slow, but very readable and well commented. Once
          you fully understand the technology behind an ESTM, explanations of
          more advanced versions of the algorithm should start to click into
          place too. If you want to understand the Wavefunction Collapse
          Algorithm, this is the place to start.

        <p>Let’s begin with a story.</p>
        <p>
          Imagine that you are planning your wedding. On top of ensuring that
          you have enough turtle doves and power ballads, you need to design the
          seating plan for dinner. Your family can be very argumentative and
          volatile, so this will be difficult. Your dad can’t sit within 2
          tables of your mum. Your cousin will get grumpy and lonely if she
          doesn’t sit with your other cousin. And it’s probably for the best if
          Uncle Roy doesn’t sit with the environmentalist wing of your partner’s
          family. With only 5 hours left until the caterers start to arrive, you
          decide to attack this seemingly intractable problem using the
          Wavefunction Collapse Algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>You start with a long list of rules and a blank seating plan.</p>
